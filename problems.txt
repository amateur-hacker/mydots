🟢 LEVEL 1 — Fundamentals (don’t rush, don’t be sloppy)

These test whether you actually understand variables, loops, and arrays.

Swap Without Temp

Swap two numbers without using a third variable.

Then explain why this works (not just code).

Reverse an Array In-Place

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Constraint: O(1) extra space

Count Positives, Negatives, Zeros

Given an integer array, return counts of:

positives

negatives

zeros

Find the Largest & Second Largest

One pass only.

No sorting.

Handle duplicates correctly.

🟡 LEVEL 2 — Array Thinking (this is where people start failing)

If you struggle here, your fundamentals are shaky.

Move All Zeros to the End

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]

Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Must preserve order of non-zero elements.

O(n), O(1).

Find Missing Number (0 to n)

Input: [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Constraint: O(n), O(1).

Check If Array Is Sorted and Rotated

Example valid:

[3,4,5,1,2]

Invalid:

[3,4,1,5,2]

Remove Duplicates In-Place (Sorted Array)

Return new length.

Modify array directly.

🟠 LEVEL 3 — Index Mapping & In-Place Logic (serious DSA)

These prepare you for real interview problems.

First Missing Positive
(You just learned this — now re-implement from memory.)

Find All Numbers Missing in Range [1, n]

Input: [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output: [5,6]

O(n), no extra space.

Find Duplicate Number

Exactly one duplicate.

No extra space.

Don’t modify array.

🔴 LEVEL 4 — “Are you actually good?” problems

Most people can’t do these cleanly.

Next Permutation

Modify array in-place.

Longest Subarray with Sum = K

Positive numbers only → sliding window.

Then solve with negatives allowed.

Product of Array Except Self

No division.

O(n), O(1).

Rules (follow or don’t bother)

Use TypeScript

No libraries

No cheating with sort/set/map unless allowed

Write clean code

Explain your logic after coding

Solve Level 1, Question 2: Reverse an array in-place

Post your code.
I’ll rip it apart if it’s bad — or approve it if it’s solid.
